# linux-dev-setup
Contains files and scripts to get you started developing in Linux. This repository is meant to help beginners as they try and set up their development environment on Linux.

## How to Use
One way to do it is to create a .bashrc or .vimrc and copy and paste what I have. What I think is the better way is to create symbolic links. For example, 
'ln -s path/to/new_bashrc .basrc'. This way you can keep the new files on a flash drive for example and be able to use the files on whatever machine you are using.

## new_bashrc
This file contains mainly the default bash settings for the Raspberry Pi. It was changed to look at the .dircolors file.

## new_vimrc
This file is a simple vimrc file. If you are new to vim then this file contains some additions that will help make vim easier to understand.

## new_colors
This file changes the default colors of the text on the command line.


### Contributing
